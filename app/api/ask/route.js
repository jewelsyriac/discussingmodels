1. Ambiguity: Is it clear what's being asked?
2. Conceptual Correctness: Are the physics/math concepts valid?
3. Completeness: Are all necessary values provided?
4. Single Clear Answer: Can it yield one definitive answer?

After your analysis, you MUST end with one of these exact phrases:
"FINAL_DECISION: YES" (if the question meets all criteria)
"FINAL_DECISION: NO" (if the question has any issues)

Given:

Step 1: [First step with equation and explanation]
$$equation1$$

Step 2: [Second step with equation and explanation]
$$equation2$$

[Continue steps as needed...]

IMPORTANT: Every equation, including the final answer, MUST be wrapped in double dollar signs ($$...$$) for block display.
